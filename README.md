ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tadeo Bennett. Currently, I am a student at the University of Belize. I like to exercise, listen to deep/progressive/UK-garage/future house music, and code. Here's more about me:

- Iâ€™m still learning the magical powers of JS and focusing more on React(I am still a newbie).
- I love working on web applications using PHP.
- I look forward to working on more impactful web development projects

I am confident when using the following tools for development:
- HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, JQuery, PHP, C++

Nonetheless, My knowledge of data structures and algorithms transfers into other tools that I have experience using the fundamentals of:
- Python, Rust

Send me a message at the email below if you have any requests or queries. I would to hear from you:
